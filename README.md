PDELab
======

This is version 2.7-git of the PDELab library.

[PDELab][0] is a PDE solver toolbox built on top of DUNE, the [Distributed and Unified
Numerics Environment][1].

The main intention is to provide a good set of high-level abstractions to allow
for a reasonably quick development of simulation codes, while at the same time
offering the flexibility to implement new numerical methods and optimize for
specific simulation scenarios.

This package contains the PDELab library code. For application examples see the
companion package dune-pdelab-howto.

If you have downloaded a release tarball, you can find the autogenerated Doxygen
API documentation in doc/doxygen/html. Otherwise, you can build this documentation
yourself by calling "make doc". Note that you need Doxygen and GraphViz available at
configure time to be able to build the documentation.

If you need help, please ask on our [mailinglist][8]. Bugs can also be submitted
to the PDELab [bugtracker][9] instead.

Dependencies
------------

PDELab depends on the following software packages:

* DUNE core libraries (dune-common, dune-geometry, dune-grid, dune-istl,
  dune-localfunctions) version 2.7-git, and their respective dependencies.

* The dune-typetree library, version 2.7-git. You can obtain a [source package][0] or
  clone the [repository][10].

* PDELab's compiler requirements differ slightly from the underlying DUNE
  libraries: We require at least GCC 5 in C++14 mode. PDELab should also work
  with very recent versions of ICC (icpc 18.0.0+) and current clang (5+).

The following software is optional:

* [PETSc 3.3][5] - there is an experimental backend for PETSc vectors and
  matrices. See [CHANGELOG.md][11] for details. WARNING: The PETSC backend is
  currently broken.

* [Eigen 3.1.0][6] - there is an experimental backend for Eigen vectors and
  matrices as well as some solvers. See [CHANGELOG.md][11] for details.

For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read
the [installation notes][2].
