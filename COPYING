* Version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software

  against the PDELab library, the so-called "runtime exception":

    As a special exception, you may use the PDELab source files as part of a
    software library or application without restriction.  Specifically, if other
    files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from one or
    more of the PDELab source files, or you compile one or more of the PDELab
    source files and link them with other files to produce an executable, this
    does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
    General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate any
    other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General
    Public License.

  This license is intended to be similar to the GNU Lesser General Public
  License, Version 2, which by itself isn't suitable for a template library. You
  can find a copy of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, in the file
  GPL-2 or at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0>.
