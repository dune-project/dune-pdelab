circ_in_rect.geo/circ_in_rect.msh
  A rectangular domain with a circular hole in the center.  Originally by
  Andreas Buhr.  Andreas also supplied a .msh and I'm using that one here,
  even though I was unable to get gmsh to regenerate it exactly -- even trying
  different combinations of options I would always get a diffferent number of
  nodes.
